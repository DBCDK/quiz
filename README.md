# Quiz

This is the source code, for the quiz tool on <https://quiz.dbc.dk>.
In order to try out the quiz-editing part, you need a clientId/clientSecret to login, which danish libraries can get via a request to DBC, see description on <https://openplatform.dbc.dk>

## Embedding

The quiz can be embedded in other websites like this:

```html
<div id="quizElem"></div>
<script>
  var quiz;
  function initOpenPlatformQuiz() {
    quiz = new openPlatformQuiz.Widget({
      elemId: 'quizElem',
      extraSpacing: true,
      openPlatformToken: 'fd9e275eeb36295971719a77df354f84e9f21ab3',
      quizId: 'ffdfa65b-4b14-4bec-a4bb-5f2938eca897',
      onDone: function(result) {
        console.log(result);
      }
    });
  }
</script>
<script src="https://quiz.dbc.dk/widget.js" async defer></script>
```

The `openPlatformToken` has to be retrieved dynamically, as usual for openplatform access.

If `extraSpacing` is true, extra spacing is added to the embedded quiz, so it has at least the same height as the screen.

Approach to embedding is inspired by how [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#IFrame_Player_API) and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#HelloWorld) are embedded.
With regard to IFrame vs JavaScript approach, - embedding via JavaScript is choosen as this allows a more responsive view.

Statistics about agency can be submitted with the statisticsEvent method, a la:

```
openPlatformQuiz.statisticsEvent({
    openPlatformToken: '18396c0d40f002d48809f946f96d314c1e01bcf0',
    quizId: 'ffdfa65b-4b14-4bec-a4bb-5f2938eca897',
    type: 'agency',
    subtype: '770100'
})
```

`onDone` is used for getting the quiz state after the quiz has finished.

## Development

Current version uses `create-react-app`, so just `npm install`, and then `npm start` for development. This might later change to nwb or [Neutrino](https://neutrinojs.org/) (as recommended by create-react-app) to support npm package building.

Designwise we try to follow the guidelines [Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction). This simplifies and improves the visual design process, by avoiding a lot of bikeshedding, and having a common language. We use the components from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), and the same approach with JSS for styling.

State management is done using redux/thunk/immutable. All `dispatch`es and `state` access happens through **action creators** and **selectors**.

Code style is enforced using prettier.
